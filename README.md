### Todo:  
- Find a way to DL the data (or at least a portion to start off with)
- Start Django App and load the data
- Make a simple page with bootstrap that has a search bar with autocomplete for the items
- The crafting companion
- Other stuff  
  
+ May need to add the item ID later if we want official tooltip and lookup
