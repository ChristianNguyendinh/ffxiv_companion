### Todo:   
- The crafting companion  
---- check boxes  
---- some styling for what we currently have  
---- Make a table for recipes?  
---- When a user adds a recipe for an item, it adds a list of item IDs for a recipe w/ foreign key?  
---- tooltips?  
- Maybe a search of where to find the items?  
---- another table with foreign key of vendors to find items?? eh..  
  
!!!! + <strike>May</strike> DO need to add the item ID later if we want official tooltip and lookup
---- shit
